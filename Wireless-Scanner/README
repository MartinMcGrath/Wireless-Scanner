 
# NAME
       Wireless::Scanner - a small utility which scan near Bluetooth and Wifi networks

# INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	// make test (STILL IN BETA, SKIPPING FOR NOW..)
	make install

# USAGE
        sudo perl WirelessCan
        
# DESCRIPTION

## DETAILS   
   As the name suggests, this script scan the near networks, both bluetooth and wireless are shown in a pretty formatted output.
   I have uploaded an additional script "Executor.pl", which can be used as CLI in the lower part of the screen.
   for additional info see the comments in the script
     (the script need also the linux screen utility for split the screen)

# NOTE

   - The documentation will added during the project uodates, this is only an alpha, in future will be even more complex
   - Probably the bluetooth scan won't work, I am still working on it, BLE devices aren't recognized because I haven't found any BLE compatible module.
   - The script hasn't a Makefile.PL or make, for building the dependencies execute only the "install-deps.sh" script.
# TODO

  - speed up the first part
  - make an android version ( android chips doesn't support monitor mode )
  - add more "Executor" scripts
  - create a WPA_CLI error auto-detection against errors like: "Could not connect to wpa_supplicant ... "

# FUTURE INTENTIONS

  The perl programming language has a wide variety of libraries, it has a good Networking distribution but, excluding the Net::Bluetooth library,
  the bluetooth support doesn't exist.
  In a non-too-remote future I would like to built a library for controlling bluetooth 3.0 and BLE standard, I have some ideas related about the C library  which will be used.
